# Yuchen_Xia_HW3_InfoGraphic
The basis of this assignment is to take complex information – statistics, research results, data comparison, forms, charts, analysis, etc., – and present it in the most efficient and easily understood way possible. The specific difference between this form of design and traditional infographics is the dynamic nature of the interactive information design. In this context the complexity of information can parse both live and static content from a variety of sources with realtime results. This data could be drawn from data bases, user inputs, algorithms, etc., 
With the added feature of interactivity, information design can engage users in new and interesting ways that traditional mediums, both static and dynamic, have been limited in achieving. The added benefit of vector based design comes with the inherent flexibility due to the algorithm of that graphic type. All aspects of it can be targeted and manipulated to any desired outcome.
